This topic is an overview of Kubernetes Service Manager (KSM) for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

KSM for PCF enables operators
to provide application developers with access to services through the `cf marketplace`.
These services run on Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (Enterprise PKS) for consumption by
Pivotal Application Services (PAS) apps.

For more information about the `cf marketplace`,
see [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Developer Guide](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-5/devguide/index.html).

For more information about Enterprise PKS,
see [Enterprise Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service).

KSM for PCF enables operators to do the following:

* Install an Independent Software Vendor (ISV) or open source Helm chart into a PKS cluster.
* Offer an ISV or open source Helm chart as an on-demand service to PAS developers.

KSM for PCF enables app developers to do the following:

* Provision dedicated service instances onto a PKS cluster through the Marketplace.
* Consume services running on Enterprise PKS in apps running on PAS.

## <a id='features'></a> Key Features

KSM for PCF includes the following key features:

* A service broker that provisions dedicated service instances into a PKS cluster and binds service instances to PAS apps.
* A command line interface (CLI) for managing service offerings and installing a shared service instance
into a PKS cluster.
