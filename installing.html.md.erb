### <a id="storage"></a> Configure Storage

KSM for PCF requires S3-compatible buckets to store offered charts and the chart cache. 
The operator is responsible for backing up this bucket with their IaaS provider. 

If you are using a cloud storage provider that does not natively support S3 buckets, 
you must configure your cloud storage to be compatible with S3 to use KSM for PCF. 
See [Prerequisites](#storage-preq), below. 


#### <a name="storage-preq"></a> Prerequisites

To configure storage for KSM for PCF, you must do the following:

+ **Create a policy and an access key for your cloud storage provider:** Policy creation varies depending
on your cloud storage provider. Pivotal recommends that this account be solely for KSM for PCF.
You must apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your S3 store. 
The policy must give KSM for PCF permissions to list and upload buckets. 
For instructions on how to create a policy and access key, see your provider's documentation.

+ **If you are using a cloud storage provider that does not natively support S3 buckets, 
you must configure your cloud storage to be S3 compatible:** If you are using Azure Blob Storage or Google Cloud 
Storage (GCS), you can use the Minio for PCF title to do this.
For information, see the [Minio for PCF](https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/minio/)
documentation.

+ **If you are using GCS and are not using the Minio tile, you must generate a developer key:** This developer
key is used to configure **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in the below table.
For instructions on how to generate a developer key,
see [Managing developer keys for a simple migration](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#keys)
in the Google Cloud Storage documentation.

To configure storage, do the following:

1. Navigate to **PCF Ops Manager** > **Kubernetes Service Manager for PCF** > **Storage Configuration**.

1. Configure the fields as follows:

    <table class="nice">
    <tr>
    <th>Field</th>
    <th>Instructions</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Endpoint</strong></td>
      <td>Enter the S3-compatible endpoint URL for uploading backups. The URL cannot start with <code>http://</code> or <code>https://</code>. For example:<br><br>
        <ul>
          <li><code>storage.googleapis.com</code></li>
          <li><code>s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com</code></li>
        </ul>
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Region</strong></td>
        <td> Enter the region where your bucket is located.
          The region defaults to <code>us-east-1</code>.
          Some IaaS providers do not require regions for their buckets.
          For example, Google Cloud Platform Multi-Regional Storage ignores this value.
        </td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Bucket Name</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the name of your bucket.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Storage Prefix</strong></td>
        <td> Enter the path in the bucket to store backups. If this is left blank,
           objects are stored at the root of the bucket.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Access Key ID</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the S3 Access Key ID.</td>
      </tr>

      <tr>
        <td><strong>Secret Access Key</strong></td>
        <td>Enter the Secret Access Key.</td>
      </tr>

    </table>

### <a id="container"></a> Configure Container Registry

When you configure a private registry,
KSM for PCF will install in an offline environment, and can modify your Helm
charts to point to images in the private registry.
Pivotal recommends using a private registry in production.
You will obtain the following values from your container registry, such as Harbor.

To configure a private registry, do the following:

1. Click **Container Registry Configuration**.
1. Enter the **Registry Server URL**. This is the URL including your container registry hostname and project. For example, `gcr.io/myproject`.
This is the location from which KSM will push and pull images.
1. Enter the **Registry Username**. This is the username which KSM will use to push and pull images to the registry.
1. Enter the **Registry Password**. This is the password which KSM will use to push and pull images to the registry.

### <a id="errands"></a>Errands

The pre-delete errand `deregistar` removes the pre-provisioned Kubernetes service from `cf marketplace`
and deletes all associated service instances and bindings.
This errand is disabled by default.
