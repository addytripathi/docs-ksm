##<a id="0-8-27"></a> v0.8.27

**Release Date:** XXX XX, 2020

<p class="note breaking"><strong>Breaking Change:</strong> This release is incompatible with the v0.7
  beta release of <%= vars.product_short %>.
  Before you install <%= vars.product_short %> v0.8, you must uninstall
  <%= vars.product_short %> v0.7 from <%= vars.ops_manager_full %>. After you install <%= vars.product_short %> v0.8,
  you must re-add your service offerings.
  For more information, see <a href="./upgrading.html">Upgrading KSM</a>.
  </p>

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

+ Upgrade service instances with Cloud Foundry `cf upgrade <instance-name> -u` when a new version of a service offering is available. For more information, see  <a href="./using.html#upgrade-instance">Upgrade a Service Instance</a>.
+ Improve <%= vars.product_short %> stability. Fixed bugs around BOSH process monitoring and restarting. 
+ Support overriding default `values.yaml` in Helm chart package. For more information, see  <a href="./prepare-offer.html#override">(Optional) Override Chart Values</a>.
+ Listing service instances in <%= vars.product_short %> now includes Cloud Foundry instance name, org, and space. 
+ Cluster scoped charts and resources are now cleaned up from the Kubernetes cluster when the last service instance is deleted. 

### Known Issue

This release has the following issue:

+ If your chart uses custom resources, <%= vars.product_short %> might incorrectly report that a service instance
was created successfully before the custom resources are created.
This is because Kubernetes does not have a generic method to detect resource readiness.
Kubernetes primitives have known patterns for detecting readiness, but custom resource readiness is defined by its author. <br><br>
In the unlikely event that this happens, wait until the custom resources are created before binding
a service instances to an app.
This mitigates any issues with missing details in the bind response.
