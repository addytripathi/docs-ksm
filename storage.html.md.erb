This topic describes how to configure storage for <%= vars.product_full %> (<%= vars.product_short %>).

## <a id="storage"></a> Configure Storage

<%= vars.product_short %> requires S3-compatible buckets to store offered charts and the chart cache.
The operator is responsible for backing up this bucket.
Follow the instructions from your IaaS provider.

If you use a cloud storage provider that does not natively support S3 buckets,
you must configure your cloud storage to be compatible with S3 to use <%= vars.product_short %>.
See [Prerequisites](#storage-preq), below.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you change the storage configurations,
  the service offering data is lost and you must re-add the service offering to <%= vars.product_short %>.
  For offerings with multiple versions provisioned, the old versions should also be re-added.
  See <a href="./using.html#add">Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %></a>.
</p>

### <a name="storage-preq"></a> Prerequisites

To configure your cloud storage provider for <%= vars.product_short %>:

+ **Create a policy and an access key for your cloud storage provider:**
Policy creation varies depending on your cloud storage provider.
VMware recommends that this account only be used by <%= vars.product_short %>.
You should apply a minimal policy that lets the user account upload backups to your S3 store.
The policy must give <%= vars.product_short %> permissions to list and upload buckets.
For instructions on how to create a policy and access key, see your provider's documentation.

+  **If you are using Google Cloud Storage (GCS),
you must generate a developer key for GCS to use an S3 compatible API:**
This developer key is used to configure **Access Key ID** and **Secret Access Key** in the table below.
For instructions on how to generate a developer key,
see [Managing developer keys for a simple migration](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/migrating#keys) in the GCP documentation.
