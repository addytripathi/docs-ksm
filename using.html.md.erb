This topic describes how to use <%= vars.product_full %>.

##<a id='using'></a> Overview

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the KSM CLI and a generic broker deployed by the tile.
You can use <%= vars.product_short %> to do the following:

+ Offer on-demand provisioning of a dedicated service instance for developers through `cf marketplace`.
+ Create a catalog of services with customizable plans that can be deployed on multiple clusters.

To add a service offering:

1. Retrieve the credentials needed to use the KSM CLI. <br>
See [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) below.
1. Package your Helm chart and add the chart to <%= vars.product_short %>. <br>
See [Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %>](#add) below.
1. Enable access to the service offering for your developers to use. <br>
See [Enable Service Offering Access](#enable) below.

##<a id="prereq"></a>Prerequisites

Before you deploy a service offering, you must configure the service offering.
See [Preparing a Service Offering](./prepare-offer.html).


## <a id="credentials"></a> Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>

To use the KSM CLI, you need to retrieve your KSM API credentials.

To retrieve your KSM API Credentials:

1. Navigate to the **<%= vars.ops_manager_full %> Installation Dashboard** > **<%= vars.product_full %>** > **Credentials**.

1. Retrieve your **KSM API Credentials** by clicking **Link to Credentials**.

1. Record the values for `identity` and `password`.

1. Validate the credentials for <%= vars.product_short %> by running the following command:

    ```
    ksm -t http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer list
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in the above step.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in the above step.

## <a id="add"></a> Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %>

You must package your Helm charts and add the offering to <%= vars.product_short %> to enable developers
to use the service.

To add your offering to <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Package your Helm chart by running the following command from the root level of
your Helm chart directory:

    ```
    helm package .
    ```

    Verify that you now have a file named `CHART-NAME-#.#.#.tgz` in the root level of your
    Helm chart directory.

1. Add your Helm charts as a dedicated instance service offering to <%= vars.product_short %>
by doing one of the following:
    + **If you are adding a single chart,** run the following command:

        ```
        ksm -t http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer save /PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz
        ```
        Where:
        + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.
        + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
        + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
        + `PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz` is the path to the packaged chart you created in the above step.
    + **If you are adding multiple charts,** run the following command:

        ```
        ksm -t http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer save \
        /PATH-TO-KSM.YAML /PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART_1.tgz /PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART_2.tgz
        ```
        Where:
        + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.
        + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
        + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
        + `PATH-TO-KSM.YAML` is the path to the `ksm.yaml` file for your service offering.
        + `PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART_1.tgz` is the path to a packaged chart you referenced in your `ksm.yaml` file.
        + `PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART_2.tgz` is the path to a packaged chart you referenced in your `ksm.yaml` file.

        For more information about offering multiple charts, see [(Optional) Offer Multiple Charts in a Single Offering](./prepare-offer.html#multiple-charts).

1. Ensure your offering has been saved to <%= vars.product_short %> by running the following command:

    ```
    ksm -t  http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer list
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.

## <a id="enable"></a> Enable Service Offering Access

After you add your service offering, you must enable access to the service offering.

To enable access to your service offering:

1. Log in to your PAS deployment by running the following command:

    ```
    cf login -a API-URL -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD
    ```

    Where:
    + `API-URL` is the API endpoint for your PAS instance.
    + `USERNAME` is your username for your PAS instance.
    + `PASSWORD` is your password for your PAS instance.

    For more information,
    see [Getting Started with the cf CLI](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/cf-cli/getting-started.html#login).

1. Enable access to the service for all orgs by running the following command:

    ```
    cf enable-service-access SERVICE-NAME
    ```
    Where `SERVICE-NAME` is the name of the new service that you viewed in step 6 of
    [Add a Service Offering to <%= vars.product_short %>](#add) above.


1. View the newly created service plan by running the following command:

    ```
    cf marketplace
    ```

## <a id="update-offering"></a> Update a Service Offering

When you update a service offering in <%= vars.product_short %>, any newly-created service instances
use the latest version of the service offering.
Existing instances must be manually upgraded.
See [Upgrade a Service Instance](#upgrade-instance) below.

To update a single chart service offering in  <%= vars.product_short %>:

1. Update your chart by doing one of the following:
      + **If you are updating a single chart,** after you edit your Helm chart,
        update the chart version in the `Chart.yaml` file.
      + **If you are adding multiple charts,** after you edit the Helm charts and `ksm.yaml`,
        update the chart versions in the `Chart.yaml` files.
        For more information about multiple charts and `ksm.yaml`,
        see [(Optional) Offer Multiple Charts in a Single Offering](./prepare-offer.html#multiple-charts).

1. Package an updated version of your Helm chart by running the following command from the root level of your Helm chart directory:

     ```
     helm package .
     ```

     Verify that you now have a file named `CHART-NAME-#.#.#.tgz` in the root level of your Helm chart directory.

     <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you are updating multiple charts, run the above command for each updated chart.
     </p>

1. Update the service offering by running one of the following commands:
    + **If you are adding a single chart,** run the following command:

        ```

## <a id="upgrade-instance"></a> Upgrade a Service Instance

To upgrade service instances:

1. Update and package a new version of your Helm chart by doing the steps in [Update a Service Offering](#update-offering) above.

1. Retrieve and record your mTLS credentials by doing the steps in [Run Helm Commands](./troubleshoot.html#helm).

1. Retrieve the GUID for the service instance that you are upgrading by running the following command:

    ```
    ksm -t http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD instance list SERVICE-OFFERING
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.

    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
    + `SERVICE-OFFERING` is the name of the service offering that you want to see service instances of.

    Record the value in `INSTANCE GUID` column for the instance you are upgrading.

1. Retrieve the Helm release name for a service instance by running the following command:

    ```
    helm ls --tiller-namespace kibosh --tls --tls-cert PATH-TO-CERT --tls-key PATH-TO-KEY --namespace=kibosh-INSTANCE-GUID
    ```
    Where:
    + `PATH-TO-CERT` is the path to the certificate file you created in [Run Helm Commands](./troubleshoot.html#helm).
    + `PATH-TO-KEY` is the path to the private key file you created in [Run Helm Commands](./troubleshoot.html#helm).
    + `INSTANCE-GUID` is the GUID of the service instance retrieved in the previous step.

    Record the value in the `NAME` column. This is the release name of the service instance
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If your service offering has multiple charts, the above command might list multiple releases. Record the release names for charts that have been updated.
    </p>

1. For each Helm release, upgrade your service instances by running the following command:

    ```
    helm upgrade RELEASE-NAME /PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz --tiller-namespace kibosh --tls --tls-cert PATH-TO-CERT --tls-key PATH-TO-KEY
    ```
    Where:
   + `RELEASE-NAME` is the name of the release you retrieved in the previous step.
   + `PATH-TO-YOUR-CHART.tgz` is the path to the updated packaged chart that was created in [Update a Service Offering](#update-offering) above.
   + `PATH-TO-CERT` is the path to the certificate file you created in [Run Helm Commands](./troubleshoot.html#helm).
   + `PATH-TO-KEY` is the path to the private key file you created in [Run Helm Commands](./troubleshoot.html#helm).

   <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The above command only applies changes to values in <code>values.yaml</code> to service instances.
     Any changes to values in <code>plans.yaml</code> are ignored.
   </p>

## <a id="delete"></a> Delete a Service Offering

 
 <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> A service offering cannot be deleted if instances of that service exist. If an offer is removed while service instances exist, then <%= vars.productshort %> will no longer be able to perform operations against that service instance (e.g. `cf update-service`).

To remove the offer, first delete all service instances using `cf delete-service SERVICE-NAME`. After all service instances have been deprovisioned, follow the step below to delete the service offering.
    </p>
  
    
1. Delete a service offering by running the following command:

    ```
    ksm -t  http://ksm.SYSTEM-DOMAIN -u USERNAME -p PASSWORD offer delete YOUR-CHART
    ```
    Where:
    + `SYSTEM-DOMAIN` is your <%= vars.platform_name %> system domain URL.
    + `USERNAME` is the value of `identity` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
    + `PASSWORD` is the value of `password` you recorded in [Retrieve Credentials for <%= vars.product_short %>](#credentials) above.
    + `YOUR-CHART` is the name of the service offering you want to delete.

    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If you only have one service offering in
      <%= vars.product_short %>, you cannot delete it.
    </p>
